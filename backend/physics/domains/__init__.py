Domain-Specific Physics Modules

Each module handles a specific physics domain:
- mechanics: Statics, dynamics, kinematics
- structures: Beams, trusses, shells, FEA
- fluids: CFD, aerodynamics, hydraulics
- thermodynamics: Heat transfer, combustion
- electromagnetism: Circuits, fields, magnetics
- materials: Material physics integration
- multiphysics: Coupled domain solving

# Will be populated with domain imports as they are created
