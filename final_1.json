{"intent":"design_request","entities":{},"response":"Designing a unibike with twin turbine propulsion presents an exciting challenge, blending the simplicity of a unicycle's design with the complexity and power of turbine technology. The aim is to create a compact, efficient, and high-performance unibike that can achieve remarkable speeds and handling capabilities. Here's a concept outline:\n\n### 1. Frame and Body\n- **Material**: Aerospace-grade aluminum alloy for the main frame, chosen for its lightweight and high strength. Carbon fiber components for body panels to minimize weight and enhance aerodynamics.\n- **Structure**: The frame is designed to house the turbines centrally, distributing weight evenly for optimal balance and stability. The body shape is aerodynamically optimized to reduce drag, featuring sleek lines that encapsulate the turbines and channel airflow efficiently.\n\n### 2. Turbine Propulsion System\n- **Twin Turbines**: Two compact, high-efficiency jet turbines, mounted on either side of the unibike. These turbines are designed to be lightweight, with a high thrust-to-weight ratio, ideal for achieving significant acceleration and top speeds.\n- **Fuel System**: A built-in, aerodynamically contoured fuel tank, integrated within the frame to maintain the unibike’s slim profile. The system uses aviation-grade fuel, optimized for high performance and efficiency.\n- **Exhaust**: The exhaust system is designed to minimize heat and noise. It incorporates advanced materials and cooling systems to manage turbine temperatures effectively.\n\n### 3. Control and Stability Systems\n- **Gyroscopic Stability**: To ensure the unibike remains upright and stable at various speeds, a sophisticated gyroscopic system is integrated into the frame, automatically adjusting to the rider's movements and external forces.\n- **Control System**: Handlebar controls are connected to the turbines through an electronic management system, allowing for precise throttle, braking, and steering inputs. Additionally, foot pedals provide balance and direction control, enhancing the rider's engagement and maneuverability.\n\n### 4. Safety Features\n- **Advanced Braking System**: The unibike employs a regenerative braking system that utilizes the turbines' reverse thrust capabilities, combined with traditional disc brakes, for effective stopping power.\n- **Protective Gear**: Riders are recommended to wear specially designed protective gear, including a helmet with HUD (Heads-Up Display) for navigation and system status, and a suit equipped with impact-absorbing materials.\n\n### 5. Performance\n- **Speed and Acceleration**: The twin turbine propulsion system is capable of propelling the unibike to speeds exceeding traditional motorcycles, with rapid acceleration.\n- **Maneuverability**: Despite its high speed, the design ensures that the unibike remains maneuverable and responsive to rider inputs at any velocity.\n\n### Prototype Development\nThe next step involves detailed CAD modeling, simulation for aerodynamics, and structural analysis. Prototyping will focus on testing the turbine integration, control systems, and gyroscopic stability mechanisms under various conditions.\n\nThis unibike concept merges the thrill of unicycle riding with the exhilarating performance of jet-powered propulsion, promising a revolutionary addition to personal transportation technologies.\n\nHere's what I understand so far:\n- Wheel Config: unibike\n\nTo proceed, I need a bit more information:\n\n1. What type of terrain will it operate on? Options: paved, off_road, mixed, extreme\n\n2. Load carrying capacity? (kg)\n\n3. Maximum speed requirement?
