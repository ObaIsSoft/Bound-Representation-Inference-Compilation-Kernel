/**
 * Creates a version of `func` that can called safely in a TypeGPU function to
 * precompute and inject a value into the final shader code.
 *
 * Note how the function passed into `comptime` doesn't have to be marked with
 * 'use gpu'. That's because the function doesn't execute on the GPU, it gets
 * executed before the shader code gets sent to the GPU.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const injectRand01 = tgpu['~unstable']
 *   .comptime(() => Math.random());
 *
 * const getColor = (diffuse: d.v3f) => {
 *   'use gpu';
 *   const albedo = hsvToRgb(injectRand01(), 1, 0.5);
 *   return albedo.mul(diffuse);
 * };
 * ```
