{"intent":"design_request","entities":{},"response":"Designing a unibike with twin turbine propulsion presents an exhilarating challenge, blending the sleek, singular wheel configuration of a unibike with the powerful thrust of turbine technology. The goal is to create a design that is not only technically feasible and safe but also thrilling to ride. Here's an outline to kickstart this innovative project:\n\n### 1. Frame and Body Design\n- **Material**: Use lightweight, high-strength materials such as carbon fiber composites for the frame to ensure structural integrity while minimizing weight, crucial for balancing and propulsion efficiency.\n- **Aerodynamics**: The body should have a streamlined design to reduce drag, featuring an elongated, teardrop shape that encapsulates the rider and the mechanical components, optimizing airflow around the unibike.\n\n### 2. Wheel and Suspension\n- **Wheel**: A large, durable wheel capable of withstanding high speeds and providing stability is essential. Consider a carbon composite construction for the wheel with an integrated, puncture-resistant tire.\n- **Suspension**: A sophisticated suspension system is crucial to absorb shocks and maintain comfort and control at high speeds or on uneven surfaces. Adaptive suspension technology could adjust stiffness based on speed and terrain.\n\n### 3. Turbine Propulsion System\n- **Twin Turbines**: Two compact, high-efficiency turbines mounted on either side of the unibike. These should be designed for a high power-to-weight ratio, using advanced materials to withstand the high temperatures and stresses involved.\n- **Fuel**: Consideration for the type of fuel is crucial, with options including traditional jet fuel, biofuels, or even advanced electric turbines if weight and battery technology permit.\n- **Control System**: The turbines are controlled via an integrated electronic system that allows for precise adjustments to throttle and balance, ensuring safety and maneuverability.\n\n### 4. Safety Features\n- **Gyroscopic Stabilization**: To ensure stability at all speeds, incorporating gyroscopic stabilization technology within the unibike can help maintain an upright position and assist with steering.\n- **Emergency Parachute**: In the event of a critical system failure, an emergency parachute can be deployed to bring the unibike to a safe landing.\n- **Fire Suppression**: Given the high temperatures involved with turbine propulsion, an onboard fire suppression system is vital.\n\n### 5. Control and Interface\n- **Pilot Interface**: A heads-up display (HUD) integrated into the helmet provides real-time data on speed, fuel levels, and system status. Touch-sensitive controls on the handlebars allow for intuitive control of the turbines' power and the unibike's overall balance.\n- **Voice Activation**: For additional safety and convenience, key functions can be voice-activated, allowing the rider to maintain optimal control and focus on the environment.\n\n### 6. Environmental Considerations\n- **Emissions**: Explore the possibility of incorporating technology to minimize emissions, making the unibike more environmentally friendly.\n- **Noise Reduction**: Given the potential for high noise levels from the turbines, integrating noise reduction technology is essential for urban or populated area use.\n\nThis unibike concept combines cutting-edge technology with innovative design principles to create a unique, high-performance vehicle. Its development would require a multidisciplinary approach, involving experts in aerospace engineering, materials science, and safety protocols to bring this vision to reality.\n\nHere's what I understand so far:\n- Wheel Config: unibike\n\nTo proceed, I need a bit more information:\n\n1. What type of terrain will it operate on? Options: paved, off_road, mixed, extreme\n\n2. Load carrying capacity? (kg)\n\n3. Maximum speed requirement?
